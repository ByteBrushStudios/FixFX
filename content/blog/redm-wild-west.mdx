# RedM: Bringing the Wild West to Life

While FiveM dominates the modern crime and roleplay scene, its sibling platform RedM has been quietly building some of the most immersive and unique gaming experiences available today. Set in the rugged landscape of Red Dead Redemption 2, RedM servers transport players to an authentic Wild West where every interaction matters and every story unfolds organically.

## The Birth of RedM

### Following in FiveM's Footsteps

When Red Dead Redemption 2 launched on PC in 2019, the modding community immediately saw the potential for creating custom multiplayer experiences. The CitizenFX team, riding high on FiveM's success, recognized this opportunity and began developing RedM - a Red Dead Redemption 2 multiplayer modification platform built on the same foundation as FiveM.

RedM brought the proven FiveM formula to the Wild West:
- Custom server hosting capabilities

RegisterNetEvent('ranch:feedCattle', function()
    local playerPed = PlayerPedId()
    local coords = GetEntityCoords(playerPed)
    
    -- Check if player is near cattle feeding area
    if #(coords - vector3(-1234.5, 2345.6, 456.7)) < 5.0 then
        -- Animate feeding cattle
        TaskStartScenarioInPlace(playerPed, "PROP_HUMAN_BUM_SHOPPING_CART", 0, true)
        
        -- Update cattle health and ranch productivity
        TriggerServerEvent('ranch:updateCattleHealth', 10)
        
        -- Give player experience and payment
        TriggerServerEvent('player:addExperience', 'ranching', 25)
        TriggerServerEvent('player:addMoney', math.random(5, 15))

-- Example: Bounty hunting system
RegisterNetEvent('bounty:startHunt', function(targetData)
    local bountyAmount = targetData.reward
    local lastKnownLocation = targetData.location
    local crimeCommitted = targetData.crime
    
    -- Create bounty hunting mission
    SetNewWaypoint(lastKnownLocation.x, lastKnownLocation.y)
    ShowNotification("~r~WANTED~w~\n" .. targetData.name .. "\n~g~$" .. bountyAmount .. "~w~ reward\nLast seen: " .. targetData.locationName)
    
    -- Start tracking timer
    TriggerServerEvent('bounty:startTracking', targetData.id)
end)
```

```

### Resource Development

RedM resource development follows similar patterns to FiveM but with period-appropriate considerations:

**Manifest Example:**
```lua
fx_version 'cerulean'
game 'rdr3'
rdr3_warning 'I acknowledge that this is a prerelease build of RedM, and I am aware my resources *will* become incompatible once RedM ships.'

description 'Wild West Banking System'
version '1.2.0'

shared_scripts {
    'config.lua',
    'shared/*.lua'
}

client_scripts {
    'client/*.lua'
}

server_scripts {
    '@oxmysql/lib/MySQL.lua',
    'server/*.lua'
}

ui_page 'html/index.html'

files {
    'html/index.html',
    'html/style.css',
    'html/script.js'
}
```

### Database Integration

RedM servers often use more complex database schemas to handle period-specific data:

```sql
-- Example: Character progression table
CREATE TABLE character_skills (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    character_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    horseback_riding INT DEFAULT 0,
    gunslinging INT DEFAULT 0,
    hunting INT DEFAULT 0,
    mining INT DEFAULT 0,
    ranching INT DEFAULT 0,
    fishing INT DEFAULT 0,
    crafting INT DEFAULT 0,
    trading INT DEFAULT 0,
    reputation INT DEFAULT 50,
    honor_level INT DEFAULT 0,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Horse ownership and care
CREATE TABLE player_horses (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    owner_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    horse_name VARCHAR(100),
    breed VARCHAR(50),
    gender ENUM('male', 'female'),
    color VARCHAR(50),
    bonding_level INT DEFAULT 1,
    health INT DEFAULT 100,
    stamina INT DEFAULT 100,
    last_fed TIMESTAMP,
    location_x FLOAT,
    location_y FLOAT,
    location_z FLOAT,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
