   ```
   server-data/resources/[category]/resource-name/
   ```

3. **Add to server.cfg**
   ```bash
   ensure resource-name
   ```

4. **Configure as Needed**
   - Edit config files

## Step 4: Database Setup (Optional but Recommended)

Most modern FiveM servers use databases for player data persistence.

### Installing MySQL/MariaDB

**Windows (XAMPP):**
1. Download and install XAMPP
2. Start Apache and MySQL services
3. Access phpMyAdmin at http://localhost/phpmyadmin

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

### Database Resource Setup

1. **Install oxmysql**
   ```bash
   # Add to server.cfg
   ensure oxmysql
   set mysql_connection_string "mysql://username:password@localhost/database_name?charset=utf8mb4"
   ```

2. **Create Database**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE fivem_server CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
   CREATE USER 'fivem_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON fivem_server.* TO 'fivem_user'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

3. **Import Framework Schema**
   If using ESX or QBCore, import their database schemas:
   ```bash
   mysql -u fivem_user -p fivem_server < esx_legacy.sql
   ```

## Step 5: Framework Selection and Setup

### ESX Framework

ESX is mature, stable, and has extensive community resources.

**Installation:**
1. Download ESX Legacy from GitHub
2. Import database schema
3. Configure in server.cfg:
   ```bash
   ensure es_extended
   ensure esx_menu_default
   ensure esx_menu_dialog
   ensure esx_menu_list
   ```

**Pros:**
- Large community and resource library
- Stable and well-documented
- Professional roleplay features

**Cons:**
