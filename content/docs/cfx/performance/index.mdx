# Performance Optimization

Performance is a critical aspect of any FiveM server. This section provides comprehensive guides for optimizing both server and client performance to ensure a smooth experience for all players.

## Understanding FiveM Performance

FiveM performance depends on several key factors:

1. **Server Hardware**: CPU, RAM, and network capabilities
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Well-optimized scripts and resources
3. **Database Performance**: Query optimization and connection management
4. **Network Configuration**: Proper network settings and optimizations
5. **Client-side Performance**: Client FPS and resource usage

## Performance Monitoring Tools

CitizenFX provides several built-in tools for monitoring and optimizing performance:

1. **Resource Monitor (`resmon`)**: Shows real-time resource usage and performance metrics
2. **Profiler**: Records detailed performance data for analysis
3. **Network Monitor**: Displays network usage and latency information
4. **Debug Tools**: Provides detailed debugging information

For more information on these tools, visit the [Common Tools](/docs/cfx/common-tools) section.

## Best Practices

<Callout type="info">
  Effective performance optimization is an ongoing process, not a one-time task. Regularly monitor your server and make incremental improvements.
</Callout>

### General Performance Tips

1. **Start with a Clean Base**: Begin with a minimal server setup and add resources incrementally
2. **Regular Monitoring**: Use monitoring tools to identify bottlenecks
3. **Scheduled Maintenance**: Implement regular server restarts and maintenance
4. **Resource Management**: Keep only necessary resources running
5. **Stay Updated**: Keep your server artifacts and resources up to date

## Common Performance Issues

### Server-side Issues

1. **High CPU Usage**: Often caused by inefficient scripts or too many entities
2. **Memory Leaks**: Resources not properly cleaning up entities or data
3. **Database Bottlenecks**: Slow or unoptimized database queries
4. **Network Congestion**: Too much data being synchronized

### Client-side Issues

1. **Low FPS**: Often caused by too many entities or graphic-intensive resources
2. **Stuttering**: Usually related to synchronization issues or resource loading
3. **Long Loading Times**: Can be caused by large resource files or inefficient loading
4. **Connection Issues**: Network configuration problems or server overload

## Performance Benchmarking

Establishing performance benchmarks helps track improvements over time:

1. **Server Metrics**:
   - CPU usage percentage
   - Memory consumption
   - Network bandwidth usage
   - Entity count (vehicles, peds, objects)

2. **Client Metrics**:
   - Frames per second (FPS)
   - Loading times
   - Resource memory usage
   - Network latency

## Advanced Performance Techniques

For advanced users, consider these techniques:

1. **Custom Resource Scheduling**: Prioritize critical resources
2. **Entity Management Systems**: Implement custom entity culling
3. **Asynchronous Processing**: Use async patterns for intensive operations
4. **Distributed Systems**: Split functionality across multiple servers
5. **Resource Dependency Optimization**: Minimize dependencies between resources

<Callout type="warning">
  Always test performance optimizations in a development environment before applying them to production. Document all changes and their impacts for future reference.
</Callout>

For specific optimization techniques, refer to the individual guides in this section.

## Server Performance

### Monitor Resource Usage

Regularly check resource usage statistics to identify potential issues. High CPU or memory usage by specific resources can indicate inefficiencies that need addressing. Use the built-in Resource Monitor (`resmon`) for real-time monitoring.
