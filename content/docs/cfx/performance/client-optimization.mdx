## Graphics Settings

- Lower texture, shadow, and reflection quality in the FiveM graphics menu.
- Disable unnecessary post-processing effects.
- Set population density sliders to minimum for best FPS.

<CheckList
  items={[
    "Reduce texture, shadow, and reflection quality in settings",
    "Disable post-processing effects that impact FPS",
    "Minimize population density for better performance",
    "Remove unused client-side scripts",
    "Use resmon to identify resource-heavy scripts",
  ]}
/>

## Resource Usage

- Avoid running unnecessary client-side scripts.
- Use `resmon` to identify heavy resources.
- Remove or optimize scripts that cause FPS drops.

## Entity Management

```lua
-- Remove unused peds/vehicles
for _, entity in ipairs(GetGamePool('CVehicle')) do
    if not IsEntityOnScreen(entity) then
        DeleteEntity(entity)
    end
end
```

## NUI Optimization

- Use lightweight HTML/CSS/JS for NUI.
- Minimize NUI callbacks and DOM updates.
- Avoid large images and heavy JS libraries.

## Streaming Assets

- Compress textures and models.
- Use LODs for custom models.
- Remove unused streamed files.

## Troubleshooting

- Use F8 console to check for errors.
- Monitor FPS with built-in overlay.
- Disable overlays (Discord, Steam) if experiencing stutters.
