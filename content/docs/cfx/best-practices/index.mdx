Following best practices is crucial for creating secure, performant, and maintainable FiveM servers and resources. This comprehensive guide covers everything from development standards to server management and security protocols.

## Overview

These best practices have been compiled from years of community experience, security research, and performance optimization. Whether you're a new developer or an experienced server owner, following these guidelines will help you:

- **Build secure resources** that protect against exploits and abuse
- **Optimize performance** for smooth gameplay with many players
- **Maintain clean code** that's easy to debug and extend
- **Manage servers effectively** with proper monitoring and maintenance
- **Follow industry standards** for professional development

## Core Principles

### Security First
Always assume that client-side code can be manipulated. Validate everything on the server, implement proper permissions, and follow the principle of least privilege.

### Performance Matters
Every millisecond counts in a multiplayer environment. Optimize loops, minimize network traffic, and monitor resource usage regularly.

### Code Quality
Write maintainable, documented code that follows consistent patterns. Your future self (and your team) will thank you.

### User Experience
Design systems that are intuitive and responsive. Poor UX leads to frustrated players and empty servers.

## Essential Best Practices

### [Security Best Practices](/docs/cfx/best-practices/security)

Protect your server and players from exploits, abuse, and unauthorized access:

- **Server Hardening**: Authentication settings, request filtering, and network security
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation, SQL injection prevention, and data sanitization
- **Access Control**: Permission systems, role-based access, and command security
- **Anti-Cheat**: Detection systems, monitoring tools, and prevention strategies
- **Data Protection**: Secure storage, encryption, and privacy considerations

**Key Topics:**
- Authentication and trust settings
- Resource security patterns
- Database security
- Network protection
- Monitoring and logging

### [Performance Optimization](/docs/cfx/best-practices/performance-optimization)

Maximize server performance and provide smooth gameplay:

- **Server Configuration**: Network optimization, resource limits, and hardware tuning
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient scripting, memory management, and threading
- **Database Optimization**: Query optimization, connection pooling, and caching
- **Network Optimization**: Reducing bandwidth usage and improving responsiveness
- **Monitoring Tools**: Performance tracking and bottleneck identification

**Key Topics:**
- Network rate limits and optimization
- Script performance patterns
- Database query optimization
- Memory management techniques
- Profiling and monitoring tools

### [Resource Development](/docs/cfx/best-practices/resource-development)

Create high-quality, maintainable resources:

- **Project Structure**: Organized file layouts and naming conventions
- **Code Standards**: Consistent formatting, commenting, and patterns
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management and recovery
- **Testing**: Unit testing, integration testing, and debugging
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation and API references

**Key Topics:**
- Directory organization and file structure
- Coding standards and conventions
- Event handling best practices
- Database integration patterns
- Version control and collaboration

### [Server Management](/docs/cfx/best-practices/server-management)

Effectively manage and maintain your server:

- **Server Setup**: Initial configuration and optimization
- **Monitoring**: Performance tracking, error logging, and health checks
- **Maintenance**: Regular updates, backups, and cleanup procedures
- **Scaling**: Handling growth and load distribution
- **Community Management**: Player administration and support

**Key Topics:**
- Server configuration and setup
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Update management processes
- Player management tools

- [ ] Plan future improvements

## Security Checklist

### Server Security
- [ ] Enable request filtering and paranoia mode
- [ ] Set appropriate authentication trust levels
- [ ] Configure network security settings
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Regular security audits

### Resource Security
- [ ] Validate all client inputs on server
- [ ] Use parameterized database queries
- [ ] Implement proper permission checks
- [ ] Sanitize user-generated content
- [ ] Log security-relevant events

### Data Security
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- [ ] Use secure communication channels
- [ ] Implement proper backup encryption
- [ ] Regular backup testing
- [ ] Access control for administrative functions

## Performance Checklist

### Server Performance
- [ ] Optimize network settings
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Configure appropriate limits
- [ ] Regular performance profiling

- [ ] Clean up unused resources

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Security Pitfalls
- ❌ Trusting client-side data without validation
- ❌ Using string concatenation for SQL queries
- ❌ Storing sensitive data in client-accessible locations
- ❌ Implementing security through obscurity
- ❌ Ignoring input validation for "trusted" sources

### Performance Pitfalls
- ❌ Using `Citizen.Wait(0)` unnecessarily
- ❌ Processing all players every frame
- ❌ Not implementing proper database connection pooling
- ❌ Storing large amounts of data in memory unnecessarily
- ❌ Not monitoring resource usage regularly

### Development Pitfalls
- ❌ Not following consistent naming conventions
- ❌ Writing functions that do too many things
