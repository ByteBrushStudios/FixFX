This guide covers the complete installation and initial setup process for txAdmin, from downloading the files to launching your first server. For this guide we will use RedM but the setup should be more or less the same for FiveM!

<Steps>

  <Step>
     ## Download the FXServer Artifacts
     Download the latest version of artifacts (in this guide we are using `24769`)

     ```bash
     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/24769-315823736cfbc085104ca0d32779311cd2f1a5a8/server.7z" -OutFile "server.zip"
     Expand-Archive -Path "server.zip" -DestinationPath "C:\FiveM-Server"
     ```

     ### You can also download artifacts manually 
     we suggest using our built in Artifact Explorer for [Windows](/artifacts?platform=windows) and [Linux](/artifacts?platform=linux)
     <Callout type="info">
       **Pro Tip:** Any of the reccommended versions are what we suggest using.
       <ImageModal src="/screenshots/txadmin/recommended-versions.png" alt="Recommended Artifacts" title="Recommended artifact versions" />
     </Callout>

     But if you prefer to use `runtime.fivem.net` **DO NOT** use the **Latest** and **Optional** buttons shown below, CFX is known to not update these regularly resulting in people downloading outdated and unsupported artifacts..
     
     <Accordions>
       <Accordion title="Cause creating a system that automatically does this via your GitHub releases is sooo hard apparently... Side note it's not 🙄 wanna see how we did it?">
         <FileSource filePath="lib/examples/artifacts.go" title="lib/examples/artifacts.go" />
       </Accordion>
     </Accordions>
     
     <ImageModal src="/screenshots/txadmin/these-buttons-suck.png" alt="These Buttons Suck" title="Avoid clicking Latest and Optional buttons" />
  </Step>

  <Step>
     ## Starting your server
     Navigate to the location where we installed your server artifacts and run the server.

     ```bash
     cd C:\FiveM-Server
     ./FXServer.exe
     ```

     On first run, txAdmin will automatically initialize and provide you with a web URL and PIN
     <ImageModal src="/screenshots/txadmin/txadmin-init-console.png" alt="Initial Console" title="txAdmin initialization console" />
  </Step>

  <Step>
     ## Accessing txAdmin
     Visit the URL provided in the last step and enter the pin (Sometimes txAdmin will auto fill this for you)
     <ImageModal src="/screenshots/txadmin/txadmin-init-setup.png" alt="Initial Setup Page" title="txAdmin setup page with PIN entry" />
  </Step>

  <Step>
     ## Authorizing CFX
     You will be redirected into the CFX authorization flow, create an account or login to your existing account!
     
     <Callout type="info">
       **Pro Tip:** Creating an account on the CFX Forums will be beneficial for posting, selling or downloading resources
     </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step>
     ## Create a Master Account
     You will now be asked to create a Master Account with backup password. After you enter your Discord ID (optional) and password, agree to the terms and conditions and click register.
     
     <Callout type="warn">
       **IMPORTANT:** this information will be used if you lose access to or are to lazy to sign into your CFX account so keep it somewhere safe
     </Callout>

     <ImageModal src="/screenshots/txadmin/master-account.png" alt="Master Account" title="Master account creation" />
  </Step>

  <Step>
     ## Name your server
     Choose a name for your server this will be used in the txAdmin interface and Chat/Discord messages.
     
     <Callout type="info">
       **Pro Tip:** you can change this later in the txAdmin settings.
     </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step>
     ## Setting up FXServer
     Here is where things get interesting, now we can use txAdmin to choose what type of server to deploy

     <Steps>
        <Step>
           ### Deployment Type
           The deployment type step is where you decide how you want to setup your server, using the popular recipes to start from scratch, import existing server data or maybe deploy your own server template you can do it all here. For this guide we will be using `Popular Recipes` and starting with a fresh server

           <ImageModal src="/screenshots/txadmin/popular-recipes.png" alt="Popular Recipes" title="Popular recipe selection" />
        </Step>

        <Step>
           ### Server Template
           Now you need to choose what type of server you want (RedM or FiveM) and if you want the Vanilla Server or if you want it with a Economy Framework like ESX, QBCore and VORP.

           <Callout type="info">
              **For this guide we will setup a vanilla RedM Server:** what you choose here really depends on what kind of server you want and what you want it to do, if you want an economy (shops, jobs etc) then choose one with ESX, QBCore or VORP. Which one you use depends on what one meets your needs google them and do some research.
           </Callout>

        </Step>

        <Step>
           ### Data Location
           For this step you want to tell txAdmin where it can locate your `server.cfg` in most cases it will fill this out for you and you can just click save!

           <ImageModal src="/screenshots/txadmin/save-path.png" alt="Data Location" title="Server data location configuration" />
        </Step>

        <Step>
           ### Start the Deployer
           This step is pretty simple, just click the big green "Go to Recipe Deployer" button.

           <ImageModal src="/screenshots/txadmin/start-deployer.png" alt="Start the Deployer" title="Recipe deployer button" />
        </Step>

        <Step>
           ### Review the Recipe
           Here you can review the recipe that txAdmin will use to deploy your server, just click next and move on to the next step unless you know what you are doing here!

           <ImageModal src="/screenshots/txadmin/recipe-review.png" alt="Review the Recipe" title="Recipe review step" />
        </Step>

        <Step>
           ### Obtaining your Server License Key
           Remember earlier when we told you it would be beneficial to create a CFX Account? next you will need a server license key, you can get this from [portal.cfx.re](https://portal.cfx.re)

           <Steps>
              <Step>
                 ### Create a key
                 After you login to the portal click the "Create a key" button.
                 <ImageModal src="/screenshots/txadmin/create-a-key.png" alt="Create a Key" title="Create a key button on CFX portal" />
              </Step>

              <Step>
                 ### Name your key
                 Next you will be asked to name/describe your key. Putting your server name here is the easiest solution.
                 <ImageModal src="/screenshots/txadmin/server-license-name.png" alt="Name a Key" title="Naming your key in the CFX Portal" />
              </Step>

              <Step>
                 ### View/copy your key
                 In the next page you will see a list of your available keys, on the key we just created click the eyeball icon to show the full key you will need to select/copy it.
                 <ImageModal src="/screenshots/txadmin/view-your-key.png" alt="Copy a Key" title="Viewing your key in the CFX Portal" />
              </Step>
           </Steps>
        </Step>

        <Step>
           ### Setting your Server License Key
           Now you can paste your Server License that we copied from the last step into txAdmin. Once you have the key pasted click the "Run Recipe" button.

           <ImageModal src="/screenshots/txadmin/using-your-key.png" alt="Setting your key" title="Setting your Server License in txAdmin" />
        </Step>

        <Step>
           ### Let the deployer run
           This step is pretty simple just sit back and let txAdmin do its thing. When the process is complete a blue "Next" button will appear that you can click to move on.

           <ImageModal src="/screenshots/txadmin/deployer-1.png" alt="Deployer in action" title="The deployer in action" />
           <ImageModal src="/screenshots/txadmin/deployer-2.png" alt="Deployer done" title="The deployer is finished" />
        </Step>

        <Step>
           ### Configure your server
           Next txAdmin will allow you to modify the `server.cfg` to your liking, here you can define the servers default language, name that will be displayer in the public server list etc.

           <Callout type="info">
              **Pro Tip:** you can change this later in the txAdmin Config Editor.
           </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Welcome to txAdmin
    After saving your config in the last step you will be brought directly into the txAdmin live console where you can watch your server boot up! Your server is now ready enjoy 😊
