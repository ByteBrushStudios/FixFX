This guide covers the complete installation and initial setup process for txAdmin, from downloading the files to launching your first server. For this guide we will use RedM but the setup should be more or less the same for FiveM!

This comprehensive guide will walk you through downloading artifacts, configuring txAdmin, and deploying your first server.

## Step 1: Download FXServer Artifacts

<InfoBanner type="info" title="Artifact Selection">
For this guide, we're using artifact version 24769. Always use recommended versions for stability.

### Automated Download (Recommended)

<CommandCard 
  command='Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/24769-315823736cfbc085104ca0d32779311cd2f1a5a8/server.7z" -OutFile "server.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "server.zip" -DestinationPath "C:\FiveM-Server"'
  description="PowerShell commands to download and extract server files"
  variant="primary"
/>

### Manual Download Alternative

<QuickLinks links={[
  {
    title: "Windows Artifacts",
    href: "/artifacts?platform=windows",
    icon: "download",
    description: "Browse recommended Windows server builds"
  },

  }
]} />


<InfoBanner type="warning" title="Avoid These Buttons">
If you choose to use the official [runtime.fivem.net](https://runtime.fivem.net) for your artifacts **do not** use the "Latest" and "Optional" buttons they often point to outdated versions.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why Our Artifact System is Better">
    We built our own artifact explorer because CFX doesn't update their buttons regularly. Here's how we implemented a better solution:
    
    <Tabs items={["Service Layer", "Handler Logic", "API Route"]}>
      <Tab value="Service Layer">
        <FileSource

          }} 
        />
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab value="Handler Logic">

          }} 
        />
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Accordion>

## Step 2: Initialize txAdmin

<CommandCard

/>

## Step 4: Server Deployment

After naming your server, you'll be prompted to select a deployment type. This determines how txAdmin will set up your server files.

<CategoryGrid
  title="Deployment Type Options"
  categories={[
    {
      name: "Popular Recipes",
      description: "Recommended for beginners. Includes QBCore, ESX, and vanilla templates that auto-configure everything",

    {

      icon: "folder"
    },
    {
      name: "Remote URL Template",

    }

  columns={2}
/>

<InfoBanner type="tip" title="First Time Setup">
If this is your first server, select **Popular Recipes** - it handles all the complex configuration automatically and gives you a working server in minutes.
</InfoBanner>

### Choose Your Template

Once you select Popular Recipes, you'll see the template selection screen. Each template is tagged with its game platform (FiveM or RedM) and type (Roleplay framework or vanilla).

<InfoBanner type="info" title="Framework Selection">
Choose a **Basic Server** for simplicity and full control, or pick a **Roleplay framework** (ESX, QBCore, Qbox, VORP) if you want pre-built economy features like shops, jobs, and player progression.
