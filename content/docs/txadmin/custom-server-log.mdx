# Logging Extra Data

This feature allows you to add logging for custom commands like `/car` and `/tp` to txAdmin's server logs. To do that, you will need to edit the scripts of those commands to trigger a `txaLogger:CommandExecuted` event.

> **Note:** For now this only supports client commands!

<div className="my-6 p-4 border border-blue-500/30 bg-blue-500/10 rounded-lg flex gap-3">
  <Info className="w-5 h-5 text-blue-500 flex-shrink-0 mt-0.5" />
  <div>
    <p className="font-semibold text-blue-500 mb-1">Event Trigger</p>
    <p className="text-sm text-blue-500/90">Add the following event call inside your command function: `TriggerServerEvent('txaLogger:CommandExecuted', rawCommand)` where `rawCommand` is the full command with parameters. You don't NEED to pass `rawCommand`, you can edit this string or pass anything you want.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## How to Enable

In the client script, add the following event call inside the command function:

```lua
TriggerServerEvent('txaLogger:CommandExecuted', rawCommand)
```

Where `rawCommand` is a variable containing the full command with parameters.

## Example

In this example, we will log data from the `/car` command from the `CarCommand` script.

```lua
RegisterCommand('car', function(source, args, rawCommand)
   -- txAdmin logging callback
   TriggerServerEvent('txaLogger:CommandExecuted', rawCommand)

   local x,y,z = table.unpack(GetOffsetFromEntityInWorldCoords(PlayerPedId(), 0.0, 8.0, 0.5))

   -- there is more code here, no need to edit
end)
```

This will add an entry to txAdmin's server logs showing that the command was executed along with the parameters used.
