# Recipe Files

A Recipe is a YAML document that describes how to deploy a server properly: from downloading resources, to configuring the `server.cfg` file.

You can run a recipe from txAdmin's built-in Server Deployer. Recipes will be "jailed" to the target folder, so for example they won't be able to execute `write_file` to your `admins.json`.

At the end of the deployment process, your target folder will be checked for the presence of a `server.cfg` and a `resources` folder to make sure everything went correctly.

On the setup page you will be able to import a recipe via its URL or by selecting one of the recommended ones from the community.

## Meta Data

The recipe accepts the following default meta data:

### Engine Specific Metadata _(optional)_

- `$engine` - The recipe's target engine version
- `$minFxVersion` - The minimum required FXserver version for this recipe
- `$onesync` - The required onesync value to be set after deployment. Supports only `off`, `legacy`, `on`
- `$steamRequired` - Boolean declaring that the `steam_webApiKey` context variable MUST be set

### General Tags _(strongly-recommended)_

- `name` - The short name for your recipe. Recommended to be under 24 characters
- `version` - The version of your recipe
- `author` - The short name of the author. Recommended to be under 24 characters
- `description` - A single or multiline description. Recommended to be under 256 characters. On YAML you can use multiline strings in many ways, check [yaml-multiline.info](https://yaml-multiline.info)

## Context Variables

The deployer has a shared context between tasks, initially populated by the `variables` and the deployer step 2 (user input) for things like database configuration and string replacements.

### Default Variables

- `deploymentID` - Composed by the shortened recipe name with a hex timestamp (e.g., `PlumeESX_BBC957`)
- `serverName` - The name of the server specified in the setup page
- `recipeName`, `recipeAuthor`, `recipeVersion`, `recipeDescription` - Populated from recipe metadata if available
- `dbHost`, `dbPort`, `dbUsername`, `dbPassword`, `dbName`, `dbDelete`, `dbConnectionString` - Populated from database configuration
- `svLicense` - Required variable, inputted in deployer step 2. Will automatically replace `{{svLicense}}` in `server.cfg`
- `serverEndpoints` - The deployer will set this with endpoint_add_xxxx for the server
- `maxClients` - The number of max clients. Defaults to 48 or uses `TXHOST_MAX_SLOTS` variable

### Custom Variables

You can set custom variables in the recipe:

```yaml
variables:
  aaa: bbbb
  ccc: dddd
```

## Tasks

Tasks/actions are executed sequentially, and any failure in the chain stops the process.

> **Attention:** Careful with the number of spaces used in the indentation.

Every task can contain a `timeoutSeconds` option to increase its default value.

### download_github

Downloads a GitHub repository with an optional reference (branch, tag, commit hash) or subpath. If the directory structure does not exist, it is created.

- `src` - The repository to be downloaded. Can be a URL or `repo_owner/repo_name`
- `ref` _(optional)_ - Git reference (branch, tag, or commit hash). If none is set, queries GitHub API for default branch
- `subpath` _(optional)_ - When specified, copies a subpath of the repository
- `dest` - The destination path for the downloaded file

> **Note:** If you have more than 30 of this action, it is recommended to set the ref to avoid download errors.

#### Examples

```yaml
# Example with subpath and reference
- action: download_github
  src: https://github.com/citizenfx/cfx-server-data
  ref: 6eaa3525a6858a83546dc9c4ce621e59eae7085c
  subpath: resources
  dest: ./resources

# Simple example
- action: download_github
  src: esx-framework/es_extended
  dest: ./resources/[esx]/es_extended
```

### download_file

Downloads a file to a specific path.

- `url` - The URL of the file
- `path` - The destination path for the downloaded file (must be a file name, not a path)

```yaml
- action: download_file
  url: https://github.com/citizenfx/cfx-server-data/archive/master.zip
  path: ./tmp/cfx-server-data.zip
```

### unzip

Extracts a ZIP file to a target folder. This will not work for tar files.

- `src` - The source path
- `dest` - The destination path

```yaml
- action: unzip
  src: ./tmp/cfx-server-data.zip
  dest: ./tmp
```

### move_path

Moves a file or directory. The directory can have contents. This is an implementation of [fs-extra.move()](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/blob/HEAD/docs/move.md).

- `src` - The source path (can be file or folder, cannot be root `./`)
- `dest` - The destination path (cannot be root `./`)
- `overwrite` _(optional, boolean)_ - When true, replaces destination if it exists

```yaml
- action: move_path
  src: ./tmp/cfx-server-data-master/resources
  dest: ./resources
  overwrite: true
```

### copy_path

Copy a file or directory. The directory can have contents. This is an implementation of [fs-extra.copy()](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/blob/HEAD/docs/copy.md).

- `src` - The source path. If `src` is a directory, copies everything inside, not the directory itself
- `dest` - The destination path. If `src` is a file, `dest` cannot be a directory
- `overwrite` _(optional, boolean)_ - When true, overwrite existing file or directory. Default is `true`
- `errorOnExist` _(optional, boolean)_ - When overwrite is `false` and destination exists, throw an error. Default is `false`

```yaml
- action: copy_path
  src: ./tmp/cfx-server-data-master/resources/
  dest: ./resources
```

### remove_path

Removes a file or directory. The directory can have contents. If the path does not exist, silently does nothing. This is an implementation of [fs-extra.remove()](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/blob/HEAD/docs/remove.md).

- `path` - The path to be removed (cannot be root `./`)

```yaml
- action: remove_path
  path: ./tmp
```

### ensure_dir

Ensures that the directory exists. If the directory structure does not exist, it is created. This is an implementation of [fs-extra.ensureDir()](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/blob/HEAD/docs/ensureDir.md).

- `path` - The path to be created (cannot be root `./`)

```yaml
- action: ensure_dir
  path: ./resources
```

### write_file

Writes or appends data to a file. If not in append mode, the file will be overwritten and the directory structure will be created if it doesn't exist. This is an implementation of [fs-extra.outputFile()](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/blob/HEAD/docs/outputFile.md) and Node's default `fs.appendFile()`.

- `file` - The path of the file to be written to
- `append` _(optional, boolean)_ - When true, appends to the end of the file instead of overwriting
- `data` - The data to be written to the target path

```yaml
# Append example
- action: write_file
  file: ./server.cfg
  append: true
  data: |
    ensure example1
    ensure example2

# Write file example
- action: write_file
  file: ./doesntexist/config.json
  data: |
    {
      "someVariable": true,
      "heyLookAnArray": [123, 456]
    }
```

### replace_string

Replaces a string in the target file or files array based on a search string and/or context variables.

- `file` - String or array containing the file(s) to be checked
- `mode` _(optional)_ - Specify the behavior of the replacer
  - `template` _(default)_ - The `replace` string option processed for context variables in the `{{varName}}` format
  - `all_vars` - All variables (`{{varName}}`) will be replaced in the target file
  - `literal` - Normal string search/replace without any vars
- `search` - The string to be searched for
- `replace` - The string that will replace the `search` one

```yaml
# Single file - template mode is implicit
- action: replace_string
  file: ./server.cfg
  search: "FXServer, but unconfigured"
  replace: "{{serverName}} built with {{recipeName}} by {{recipeAuthor}}!"

# Multiple files
- action: replace_string
  mode: all_vars
  file:
    - ./resources/blah.cfg
    - ./something/config.json

# Replace all variables
- action: replace_string
  file: ./configs.cfg
  search: "omg_replace_this"
  replace: "got_it!"
```

### connect_database

Connects to a MySQL/MariaDB server and creates a database if the dbName variable is null. You need to execute this action before the `query_database` to prepare the deployer context.

This action does not have any direct attributes attached to it. Instead it uses Context Variables set in the deployer step 2 (user input).

```yaml
- action: connect_database
```

### query_database

Runs a SQL query in the previously connected database. This query can be a file path **OR** a string, but not both at the same time! You need to execute the `connect_database` before this action.

- `file` - The path of the SQL file to be executed
- `query` - The query string to be executed

```yaml
# Running a query from a file
- action: query_database
  file: ./tmp/create_tables.sql

# Running a query from a string
- action: query_database
  query: |
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `users` (
        `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
        `name` tinytext NOT NULL
    );
    INSERT INTO `users` (`name`) VALUES ('tabarra');
```

### load_vars

Loads variables from a JSON file to the deployer context.

- `src` - The path of the JSON file to be loaded

```yaml
- action: load_vars
  src: ./toload.json
```

    overwrite: true
```
