# Translation Support

txAdmin supports translation for over 30 languages for the in-game interface (menu/warn) and chat messages, as well as Discord warnings.

## Custom Locales

If your language is not available, or you want to customize the messages, you can create a `locale.json` file inside the `txData` folder based on any language file found on [our repository](https://github.com/citizenfx/txAdmin/tree/master/locale). Then go to the settings and select the "Custom" language option.

The `$meta.humanizer_language` key must be compatible with the library [humanize-duration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/humanize-duration), check their page for a list of compatible languages.

## Contributing Translations

We need the community help to translate, and keep the translations updated and high-quality.

To contribute, you will need to:

1. **Make a custom locale file** with the instructions above
2. **Name the file** using the language code from [this page](https://www.science.co.il/language/Locale-codes.php)
3. **Set the $meta.label** to the language name in English (e.g., `Spanish` instead of `Español`)
4. **Add to shared/localeMap.ts** if creating a new translation, maintaining alphabetical order
5. **Submit a Pull Request** with a few screenshots showing you tested the changes in-game
6. **Automatic checks** will run - read the output in case of any errors

### Translation Checklist

- [ ] Language code is correct from locale codes list
- [ ] `$meta.label` is in English
- [ ] Added to `shared/localeMap.ts` in alphabetical order
- [ ] All keys translated (none left in English)
- [ ] Screenshots of in-game testing attached
- [ ] Pull request description clearly states what language was translated

    <p className="text-sm text-blue-500/90">
      To quickly test your changes, edit the `locale.json` file and then in the
      settings page click "Save Global Settings" again to see the changes in the
      game menu without needing to restart txAdmin or the server.

### Validate Your Translation

To make sure you didn't miss anything in the locale file, you can:

1. Download the txAdmin source code
2. Execute `npm i`
3. Move your `locale.json` to inside the `txAdmin/locale` folder
4. Run `npm run locale:check` to validate completeness

This will tell you about missing or extra keys.

    <p className="font-semibold text-amber-500 mb-1">Performance Note</p>
    <p className="text-sm text-amber-500/90">
      The performance of custom locale files for big servers may not be ideal
      due to the way we need to sync dynamic content to clients. So it is
      strongly encouraged that you contribute with translations in our GitHub so
      they get packed with the rest of txAdmin.

2. Add your language file to the `locale` folder
3. Update `shared/localeMap.ts` with your language
4. Submit a Pull Request with evidence of testing
5. Wait for review and merge
