# Logging

In version v4.6.0, **txAdmin** added support for persistent logging with file rotation, meaning you will have an organized folder (`txData/<profile>/logs/`) containing your log files up to a maximum size and number of days.

> **Note:** Player warn/ban/whitelist actions are not just stored in the Admin Logs, but also on the players database.

## Log Types

### Admin Logs

Contains log of administrative actions as well as some automated ones like server restarts, bans, warns, settings change, and live console input.

- **Recent Buffer:** None. Methods will read the entire file.
- **Interval:** 7d
- **maxFiles:** false
- **maxSize:** false
- **Note:** Does not log the user IP unless from an authentication endpoint.

### FXServer Console Log

Contains the log of everything that happens in the FXServer console (`stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`). Any live console input is prefixed with `> `.

- **Recent Buffer:** 64~128kb
- **Interval:** 1d
- **maxFiles:** 7
- **maxSize:** 5G

### Server Logs

Contains all actions that happen inside the server, such as player join/leave/die, chat messages, explosions, menu events, and commands. Player sources are kept in the format `[mutex#id] name` where the mutex is an identifier of that server execution. If you search the file for a `[mutex#id]`, the first result will be the player join with all his identifiers available.

- **Recent Buffer:** 32k events
- **Interval:** 1d
- **maxFiles:** 7
- **maxSize:** 10G

## Configuring Log Rotation

The log rotation can be configured, so you can choose to store more or less logs according to your needs.

To configure it, edit your `txData/<profile>/config.json` and add an object inside `logger` with the key being one of `[admin, fxserver, server]`. Then add option keys according with the [rotating-file-stream library reference](https://github.com/iccicci/rotating-file-stream#options).

### Example: Custom FXServer Log Rotation

```json
{
  "logger": {
    "fxserver": {
      "interval": "1d",
      "maxSize": "2G",
      "maxFiles": 14
    }
  }
}
```

### Example: Disable Server Logs

To completely disable one of the log types, set its value to `false`.

```json
{
  "logger": {
    "server": false
  }
}
```

### Available Options

The rotating-file-stream library supports various options:

- **interval** - Rotation interval (e.g., `1d`, `7d`, `30d`)
- **maxSize** - Maximum size of rotated files to keep (e.g., `2G`, `500M`)
- **maxFiles** - Maximum number of rotated files to keep (e.g., `14`, `30`)
- **maxDays** - Maximum number of days to keep files
- **rotate** - Maximum number of files to keep in the main directory

Refer to the [library documentation](https://github.com/iccicci/rotating-file-stream#options) for a complete list of available options.

## Accessing Logs

All logs are stored in the `txData/<profile>/logs/` directory with the following structure:

```
logs/
├── admin.log
├── fxserver.log
├── server.log
└── [rotated files with timestamps]
```

You can access these logs directly from the file system or through the txAdmin web panel under:

- **Admin Logs:** `txAdmin > Logs > Admin Logs`
- **FXServer Console:** `txAdmin > Logs > FXServer Console`
- **Server Logs:** `txAdmin > Logs > Server Logs`
