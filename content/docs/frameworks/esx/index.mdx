## Quick Start

### Basic ESX Integration

```lua
-- Get ESX object (modern method)
ESX = exports['es_extended']:getSharedObject()

-- Player management
local xPlayer = ESX.GetPlayerFromId(source)
local playerData = ESX.GetPlayerData() -- Client-side

-- Economy operations
xPlayer.addMoney(1000)
xPlayer.removeAccountMoney('bank', 500)

-- Inventory management
xPlayer.addInventoryItem('bread', 5)
local itemCount = xPlayer.getInventoryItem('water').count

-- Job system
xPlayer.setJob('police', 2)
if xPlayer.job.name == 'police' then
    -- Police-specific code
end
```

### Essential Events

```lua
-- Player loaded (client)
RegisterNetEvent('esx:playerLoaded', function(xPlayer)
    ESX.PlayerData = xPlayer
    -- Initialize client-side systems
end)

-- Job changed (client)
RegisterNetEvent('esx:setJob', function(job)
    ESX.PlayerData.job = job
    -- Update UI/permissions
end)

-- Player loaded (server)
AddEventHandler('esx:playerLoaded', function(playerId, xPlayer)
    -- Server-side player initialization
end)
```

## Architecture

ESX follows a modular architecture where each system is handled by separate resources:

- **es_extended** - Core framework
- **esx_society** - Organization management
- **esx_datastore** - Data persistence
- **esx_menu_*** - UI menu systems
- **Job Resources** - Police, ambulance, mechanic jobs
- **Economy Resources** - Shops, banks, real estate
