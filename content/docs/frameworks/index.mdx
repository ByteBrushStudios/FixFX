## Choosing a Framework

When selecting a framework for your FiveM server, consider:

1. **Community Support**: Larger communities typically mean more resources and faster support
2. **Documentation**: Well-documented frameworks are easier to learn and extend
3. **Performance**: Some frameworks are more optimized than others
4. **Features**: Different frameworks excel in different areas
5. **Development Activity**: Active development means bugs are fixed and features are added

## Framework Components

Most FiveM frameworks include:

- **Core Systems**: Player management, inventory, jobs, etc.
- **Database Integration**: For persistent data storage
- **UI Components**: For user interaction
- **Resource Management**: For handling server resources
- **API**: For extending functionality

## Framework Integration

Regardless of which framework you choose, follow these best practices:

1. **Follow Documentation**: Use official guides when available
2. **Respect Dependencies**: Understand how resources depend on each other
3. **Maintain Compatibility**: Test thoroughly when upgrading
4. **Contribute**: Report bugs and contribute improvements
5. **Share Knowledge**: Document your solutions for others
